![Rat Attack!](https://github.com/zmwf129/epic-win-side-scroller/assets/149950646/3920be53-363b-4d83-b6e2-7ceecf4efde8)

## THEME: 
Rat Attack! is a 2D side-scroller in which you play as an exterminator tasked with neutralizing the out-of-control rat infestation in the city sewers. Something is wrong with these rats - the deeper you go, the weirder they get. Fight through the rabid vermin and discover the source of their power.

- You cannot progress to the next level until all rats on current level have been exterminated
- Enemies donâ€™t follow the player, but move back and forth within a small boundary (up and down or side to side)
- Enemies get stronger and fewer as you progress through the levels (getting closer to the source of nuclear waste)

LEVEL 1:
- Normal rats (not evolved), numerous but weak enemies
- Sewers appear normal - brown/black water, rubbish

LEVEL 2:
- Beefy, bloody rats, fewer in number but stronger (require more shots to kill)
- Sewers show signs of nuclear waste - neon green seeping into water, biohazard signs, corroded pipes

LEVEL 3:
- Final level is a room at the end of a tunnel
- Rat king, AKA final boss, lives there protecting the pile of nuclear waste - the source of their power!!!

## ROLES IN DEVELOPMENT
Amanda: 
- Game conceptualisation and structure/outline - Contributed to the narrative and layout of the game during conceptualisation, e.g. takes place in the sewers, three levels with gradually stronger, but fewer enemies, with one final boss at the end, where it is revealed that the mutated rats have been drawing their power from improperly disposed nuclear waste. Worked with River to determine the details of where and how assets will be used in the game.
- Audio production (music and SFX) and implementation - Currently in the process of composing a simple soundtrack for the game, as well as creating sound effects (shooting, impact, etc.). I will handle the code relating to implementation of the music and SFX into the game.
- Created moodboard/aesthetic approach and wrote README (with the exception of the following writing).

Baar:

- Level design - Conceptualised the RPG format and basic level design e.g. came up with the idea of the player being able to walk on interconnected pipes that are on top of lakes of sewer water, as well as concrete platforms, through various sketches.
- Miscellaneous graphic design - Created a potential logo for the game through photo editing software (after coming up with the name). Currently designing opening and end screens for the game with potential animations.

River: Contributed to the narrative and layout of the game during conceptualisation, e.g. takes place in the sewers and with one final boss at the end. Added the assets (acid, pipes and sprites), created the collisions on the tilemap so the player can't walk onto the acid, made it so the sprite would face the direction the player inputed (W is forward), started to create the enemy class, added the player assets to the code so the assets would appear and be controllable.
